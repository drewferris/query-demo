            Manchester United Football Club is a professional football club
            based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, that competes in
            the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Nicknamed
            "the Red Devils", the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football
            Club in 1878, changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and
            moved to its current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910. Manchester
            United have won more trophies than any other club in English
            football,[5][6] with a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, five
            League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. United have also
            won three UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA Europa League, one UEFA
            Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and
            one FIFA Club World Cup. In 1998–99, the club became the first in
            the history of English football to achieve the continental European
            treble.[7] By winning the UEFA Europa League in 2016–17, they became
            one of five clubs to have won all three main UEFA club competitions.
            The 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players. In
            1968, under the management of Matt Busby, Manchester United became
            the first English football club to win the European Cup. Alex
            Ferguson won 38 trophies as manager, including 13 Premier League
            titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions Leagues, between 1986 and
            2013,[8][9][10] when he announced his retirement. Manchester United
            was the highest-earning football club in the world for 2016–17, with
            an annual revenue of €676.3 million,[11] and the world's third most
            valuable football club in 2019, valued at £3.15 billion ($3.81
            billion).[12] As of June 2015, it is the world's most valuable
            football brand, estimated to be worth $1.2 billion.[13][14] After
            being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was
            purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club
            at almost £800 million, after which the company was taken private
            again, before going public once more in August 2012, when they made
            an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.
            Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs
            in the world,[15][16] and has rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester
            City, Arsenal and Leeds United.
